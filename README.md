# Sorting Algorithm Performance Comparison ðŸ”¥

This C++ code implements various sorting algorithms and measures their performance using the high_resolution_clock from the <chrono> library. The sorting algorithms included in this code are:

1. Quick sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Selection sort
5. Merge sort

The main purpose of this code is to compare the execution time of these sorting algorithms when sorting an array of randomly generated integers.


After running the code, the user can analyze the execution time of each sorting algorithm and compare their performance. Lower execution time indicates better performance in terms of speed.

Chart Representation:

To visualize the time differences between the sorting algorithms, a chart can be created using the data obtained from running the code. The x-axis can represent the sorting algorithms, and the y-axis can represent the time taken for each algorithm in nanoseconds.
